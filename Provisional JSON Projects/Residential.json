    "description": "The Bruce Crescent project required conceptual rendering for a client in Westville. Working hand-in-hand with an interior decorator we have managed to showcase the exterior of this elegant family home. This home features clean lines, purpose-made aluminium louvres for added privacy and a matching custom gate. An attractive and spacious outdoors area will definitely be a focal point when it comes to wowing guests, featuring a patio area with a pool and a lush garden. This site is 2033 sqm in size, leaving more than enough space for the outbuilding and a mini soccer field."
